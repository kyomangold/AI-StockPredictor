# Architecture Overview
The architecture of the software system follows a modular design that promotes separation of concerns and allows for scalable development. The system is structured around key components that interact with each other through well-defined interfaces.

*Note: The architecture diagram is currently empty. It should typically display the various components of the system, their interactions, and data flow between them.*

## Technology Stack
1. **Frameworks:**
   - **Spring Boot**: Used for building the backend RESTful services.
   - **Angular**: Used for developing the frontend single-page application (SPA).

2. **Databases:**
   - **PostgreSQL/MySQL**: Relational database management system used for data storage.

3. **Libraries:**
   - **JPA/Hibernate**: Used for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) in data access.
   - **RxJS**: Library for reactive programming used in Angular for managing asynchronous data streams.

4. **Development Tools:**
   - **Maven/Gradle**: Build tools used for managing dependencies and project builds.
   - **Docker**: Used for containerizing the application.

5. **Testing Frameworks:**
   - **JUnit**: Used for unit testing in the Spring Boot application.
   - **Karma/Jasmine**: Used for unit testing Angular components.

## Component Architecture
1. **Backend Components:**
   - **Controllers**: Handle incoming HTTP requests and return responses.
   - **Services**: Contain business logic and interact with repositories for data access.
   - **Repositories**: Abstract database operations and handle data retrieval and persistence.

2. **Frontend Components:**
   - **Modules**: Angular modules encapsulating related components, services, and routes.
   - **Components**: Individual UI elements that represent views and handle user interaction.
   - **Services**: Provide shared logic and state management across components.

## Data Architecture
The application uses a relational database for data storage. The schema typically consists of various tables representing entities that relate to the application's domain. Data flows from the UI to the backend via HTTP REST calls, processed by services that interact with the database through repositories.

## API Architecture (if applicable)
The backend exposes RESTful endpoints following standard conventions:
- **GET**: Retrieve data (e.g., GET /api/items).
- **POST**: Create new resources (e.g., POST /api/items).
- **PUT**: Update existing resources (e.g., PUT /api/items/{id}).
- **DELETE**: Remove resources (e.g., DELETE /api/items/{id}).

No authentication mechanisms are detailed; additional inquiry into the codebase may provide this information.

## Security Architecture (if found)
Currently, there are no observed security measures documented in the codebase, such as authentication or authorization patterns.

## Deployment Architecture (if applicable)
As containerization is mentioned, the application is likely being deployed using Docker, which includes:
- Docker images for the backend and frontend.
- Optional orchestration through Docker Compose for multi-container setups.

## Architectural Patterns
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: The backend follows the MVC architectural pattern where controllers manage incoming requests, services encapsulate business logic, and repositories handle data access.
- **Component-based Architecture**: The frontend Angular application has a component-based architecture, which aids in reusability and maintainability of UI code.

## Key Design Decisions
- Adoption of Spring Boot for backend development to leverage its convention over configuration approach and rapid application development capabilities.
- Use of Angular for the frontend to take advantage of its robust SPA capabilities and reactive programming model.
